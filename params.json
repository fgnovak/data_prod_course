{"name":"Data prod course","tagline":"","body":"Stock Price History with Running Average\r\n========================================================\r\nauthor: F. Novak\r\ndate: June 2015\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\n- Retrieve stock price history for the (hard coded) stock symbol\r\n- Add a column with the date and a column with the running average of the closing price\r\n- Plot the closing price (grey) and running average (red)\r\n- Allow modification of days in running average using slider bar\r\n\r\n\r\nEasy to use\r\n========================================================\r\n* Launch app and the time history of the programmed closing stock price will appear, along with the running average of the price.\r\n    https://fgnovak.shinyapps.io/dp_project\r\n* Select/change the number of days in the average with the slider bar, and the new graph appears automatically.\r\n* To launch app locally:\r\n  + Copy ui.R and server.R from Github into working directory\r\n  + Launch app by typing runApp() at the command line  (alternatively, open ui.R or server.R and hit \"Run App\" button)\r\n\r\nDefault result\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\n```{r, echo=FALSE,results='hide'}\r\n## Libraries\r\n  library(quantmod)\r\n  library(lubridate)\r\n\r\n## Get data and add date column\r\n  getSymbols(\"IWM\", src = \"google\")\r\n  IWM <- data.frame(IWM)\r\n  d <- row.names(IWM)\r\n  IWM$date <- as.POSIXct(d,format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\r\n\r\n## Define function to calculate moving average\r\n  ma <- function(x,n=20){filter(x,rep(1/n,n), sides=1)}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\r\nplot(IWM$date,IWM$IWM.Close, \r\n      type = \"l\",\r\n      xlab = \"date\",\r\n      ylab = \"price at close ($)\",\r\n      col = \"grey\")\r\nlines(IWM$date,ma(IWM$IWM.Close), col = \"red\")\r\n```\r\n- The number of days in the average is adjustable with slider provided\r\n\r\nPlanned features for future revisions\r\n========================================================\r\n- Provide Ability to select a symbol in lieu of hard coded symbol\r\n- Provide ability to select up to 2 symbols\r\n- Plot vertical lines at dates when moving average crosses data","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
